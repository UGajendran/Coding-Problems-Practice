# Problem Statement:
# Given a string containing multiple words, the task is to compute a numerical value 
# for each word based on the absolute differences of the first and last letters moving inward.
# If a word has a middle letter (odd length), its alphabetical position is added.
# The final output is obtained by concatenating the computed values of all words.

# Approach:
# - Split the input string into words.
# - Convert each word to uppercase for uniformity.
# - Use a two-pointer technique to calculate the absolute differences of letter pairs.
# - If the word has an odd length, add the middle letterâ€™s alphabetical position.
# - Concatenate the computed values of all words to form the final result.
# - Return the concatenated number as an integer.
